# narcissistic_number_check

A Narcissistic Number is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example, take 153 (3 digits):  
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

The isNarcissistic function accepts a value and returns true or false depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number.
